  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: 01/12/2025</p>

  <p>
    This refund policy explains the rules regarding cancellation and refunds for the purchase of
    digital access to LifeInTheUKTestSupport.co.uk, provided by
    <strong>Testrada Pte Ltd</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Digital content and right to cancellation</h2>

  <p>
    The product you purchase consists of <strong>digital content</strong>
    (online access to the test preparation platform),
    which is delivered immediately after payment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under applicable consumer protection rules for digital content,
    the right to cancel does not apply once:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>delivery of the digital content has begun, and</li>
    <li>you have expressly agreed to immediate access after payment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because access to the platform is provided <strong>immediately after payment</strong>,
    and because the purchase implies consent to instant delivery of digital content,
    <strong>standard cooling-off or cancellation periods do not apply</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No refunds after access is activated</h2>

  <p>
    Once access has been granted — typically within seconds of payment —
    the purchase <strong>cannot be refunded</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>This applies regardless of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>whether you have logged in or not,</li>
    <li>whether you have completed any tests or exercises,</li>
    <li>whether you plan to use the platform later,</li>
    <li>whether you pass or fail the official Life in the UK Test.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Exception: access was never delivered</h2>

  <p>
    A refund may only be considered if:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>access was never delivered due to a technical issue on our side, and</li>
    <li>you contact us in writing within a reasonable time after purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The following situations <strong>do not</strong> qualify for a refund:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>an incorrect email address entered at checkout,</li>
    <li>lack of access to your own email account,</li>
    <li>dissatisfaction with results, difficulty level, or content style,</li>
    <li>changes in personal circumstances, plans, or preferences.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Contact and support</h2>

  <p>
    If you believe there has been an error with activation or access,
    please contact us at:
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="mailto:admin@civiclearn.com">admin@civiclearn.com</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will assist in verifying your account, correcting any issues,
    and ensuring you receive access to the product you purchased.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Personal data</h2>
